# Web-Scraper-BWH
***Our program is a web scraper tool that scrapes the users' prefered job posting from indeed.com.***

# Programs Functionality
We utilized the beautifulsoup package to parse the HTML data from that site. Subsequently, we developed a python program that manipulates the data in the html
to return the job title, company name and link to the specific job posting.
These data are then moved to a csv file of the users choosing.
Our program's process was eased by utilizing github to commit, push, and pull to merge our different codes.

Consequently, we've been able to ease the process of job-searching for college students by creating a working program that creates a csv file of job postings and their attributes 
without the grueling process of searching from different pages on indeed.

# How to Run The Program
